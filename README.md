## Abstract

Coral reefs, one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, are facing the threat of extinction. This is projected to cause severe environmental damage, especially on the fronts of climate change and marine life. Although multiple efforts are being made to evaluate coral reef health and revitalize those witnessing severe bleaching, these efforts remain expensive and unsustainable. In this project, we study the capability of using satellite data from NASAâ€™s LandSat-8 and MODIS-Terra to detect coral reef presence and evaluate coral bleaching severity. We adopt a multi-faceted approach by merging data from Allen Coral Atlas and Global Coral Bleaching Dataset with satellite data in the Caribbean and Great Barrier Reef regions. Using XGBoost, we achieve 96.5\% accuracy in identifying coral/algae, implement a temporal voting-based classifier to distinguish coral from algae, and achieve 96.94\% weighted precision in evaluating bleaching severity in the Great Barrier Reef. Using this machine learning pipeline and the dashboard developed from it, coral reef experts can identify regions where the reefs are at risk and act to revitalize them, all while viewing metrics showing trends in sea surface temperature in those areas.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data Collection

## Modeling
1). Coral Presence


2). Bleaching

## Streamlit Dashboard for the Northern Caribbean
A dashboard that can be used to make real time predictions for a single location. Utilizes our coral presence models to determine whether the location is coral or not. If the prediction is coral, our bleaching model will be used to output a level of risk to the coral's health as well as a bleaching analysis. The user may use the date input to see the change in sea surface temperature over a 90 day period.
